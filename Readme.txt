MapBom version 0.2.7
====================
04/02/2010

Improvements since the last version:

* Windows installer
* Freemind does not need to be installed. A local version has been installed with MapBom, even for those without admin rights! Java Runtime does need to be installed however.
* MapBom now has access to Ireland Syteline. Irish assemblies are marked with an Irish flag.
* Experimental pdf drawing links. Any pdf files placed in C:\Program Files\MapBom\Drawings get linked to in the mindmap.

* If you can't use Freemind for some reason you can try the following:
    - get the mindmap file (C:\Program Files\MapBom\BOMmindmap.mm and copy it to \\renport\SPD\Shared Documents\Freemind\mindmaps
    - in a web browser go to: http://renport/SPD/Shared%20Documents/Freemind/mindmaps.html?mindmaps/BOMmindmap.mm
